# 🌌 ObscuraVerse

ObscuraVerse is a mysterious and evolving social platform where users anonymously share cryptic secrets — called **Whispers**.  
An **AI engine** silently analyzes these whispers, detecting hidden patterns and linking them into a **living conspiracy graph**, revealing mysteries no single person could uncover alone.

Think of it as a **collaborative puzzle game meets social storytelling** — every message is a clue, and together they form an ever-changing mystery.
